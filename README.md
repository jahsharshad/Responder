During this time where COVID-19 is coming to a close, and seniors are looking to move to new homes in new areas, many are unsure whether ambulances will reach there in time in the case of an emergency. There were not many solutions to this problem, so we took this matter into our own hands.

Welcome to Responder, the first emergency service response time visualizer and predictor! Specifically for senior citizens, our web application can predict emergency service response times for their specific address and their county in general as well as showing directions to the closest emergency service facility in their city and county!

We achieved this through extensive use of the Google Maps API, an accurate Random Forest Regressor machine learning model, a thorough Python backend, and several HTML and CSS files for a sleek, clean, and easy-to-use user interface. In addition, we also developed a page to educate seniors and others alike the importance of knowing response times as well as what to do when a senior is injured.

We hope that our project will keep seniors and their loved ones feeling safer and more secure knowing they’ll be safe in the event of an emergency. Creating this was also very personal to each of us as creators. We all have grandparents at home that we cherish and love, and thinking about them and their safety is what drove us as individuals to pursue our work.
